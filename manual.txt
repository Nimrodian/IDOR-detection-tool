1. Download Python 3.9 or above, and check it is installed correctly 
   by running 'python --version' in the Windows terminal/cmd.

2. Download the latest version of VS code (although it should work with any Python IDE). 

3. If using VS code, install the Python extension to allow the use of the language.
   open the folder containing the IDOR_detection.py and intercept.py files. From here 
   press Ctrl+Shift+P and type 'Python: select interpreter' and select the Python install
   Path that you just downloaded.

4. The requests library is not an automatically included library with Python. Run 
   'pip install requests' in the terminal to install it. 
 
5. Finally, the Man in the middle (mitm) proxy needs to be installed for the request
   interception to be successful. Install here: https://mitmproxy.org/ 
   As well as the proxy itself, the mitm python library is also needed. So in the terminal
   - 'pip install mitmproxy'. 
   The proxy automatically listens on Port 8080. So I recommend setting up a Firefox browser
   with a custom proxy to listen on that port. This way you can navigate an API or webapp 
   And not get any background traffic. 

   Once running the proxy and Firefox is configured to use the proxy on Local host 127.0.0.1 and port 8080
   then visit http://mitm.it/ and follow the instructions to get the trusted mitm certificate. This
   is so Firefox doesn't block all websites because it thinks MITM proxy is malicious software.
   
   The FoxyProxy firefox extension can set up a proxy listening on localhost 127.0.0.1 on port 8080:
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/

   The interception command is set-up to work 127.0.0.1 port 8080 so those settings are a must. 

6. Once that is all set-up, simply run the IDOR_detection.py script from the terminal. 
   using 'python \.IDOR_detection.py' and it should all work fine!
